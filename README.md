# visualizations
This repository is a collection of some visualization of global innovation activities

### [Maps](./Maps/) 

- [Mapping global agbio innovation clusters](./Maps/code/Mapping global agbio innovation clusters.ipynb)

    This is a sample code for producing chart 4.4, 4.5 and dynamic maps for World Intellectual Property Report 2019. 

    - [**Chart 4.4**](./Charts/chart 4.4/): is a static map displaying the geographical distribution of global Agbio patents and scientific publications.  

    - [**Chart 4.5**](./Charts/chart 4.5/): is a static map displaying the geographical distribution of global Agbio innovation clusters.

    - [**Dynamic maps**](./Charts/dynamic maps/)
: It generate an interactive maps displaying the evoluton of global agbio clusters during past two decades.

### [Streamgraph](./Streamgraph/) 

- This code makes an overview of global patenting activities 

    - [Chart 1]('./Streamgraph/charts/Chart1_pat_sector_since 1990.html'): Overview of global patenting by different technological sectors 
    - [Chart 2]('./Streamgraph/charts/Chart2_pat_subsector_since 1990.html'): Overview of global patenting by different technological fields
    - [Chart 3]('./Streamgraph/charts/Chart3_pat_subsector_share_since 1990.png'): Share of global patenting by different technological sectors
    - [Chart 4]('./Streamgraph/charts/Chart4_pat_subsector_streamgraph_since 1990.html'): An interactive streamgraph of global patenting by different technological fields
    - [Chart 5](./Streamgraph/charts/Chart5_pat_subsector_streamgraph_EE_since1950.html'): An interactive streamgraph of global patenting by different technological fields in Electrical Engineering
