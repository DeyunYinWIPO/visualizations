This repository is a collection of some visualization of global innovation activities

### [Maps](./Maps/) 

[Mapping global agbio innovation clusters](./Maps/code/Mapping_global_agbio_innovation_clusters.ipynb)

This is a sample code for producing chart 4.4, 4.5 and dynamic maps for World Intellectual Property Report 2019. 

- [Chart 4.4](./Maps/Charts/chart4.4/): is a static map displaying the geographical distribution of global Agbio patents and scientific publications.  

- [Chart 4.5](./Maps/Charts/chart4.5/): is a static map displaying the geographical distribution of global Agbio innovation clusters.

- [Dynamic maps](./Maps/Charts/dynamicmaps/)
: It generate an interactive maps displaying the evoluton of global agbio clusters during past two decades.


### [Streamgraph](./Streamgraph/) 

This [code](./Streamgraph/code/streamgraph_global_patenting.ipynb) makes an overview of global patenting activities.

Charts include: 

- [Chart 1](./Streamgraph/charts/Chart1_pat_sector_since1900.html): Overview of global patenting by different technological sectors. 

- [Chart 2](./Streamgraph/charts/Chart2_pat_subsector_since1900.html): Overview of global patenting by different technological fields.

- [Chart 3](./Streamgraph/charts/Chart3_pat_subsector_share_since1990.png): Share of global patenting by different technological sectors.

- [Chart 4](./Streamgraph/charts/Chart4_pat_subsector_streamgraph_since1950.html): An interactive streamgraph of global patenting by different technological fields.

- [Chart 5](./Streamgraph/charts/Chart5_pat_subsector_streamgraph_EE_since1950.html): An interactive streamgraph of global patenting by different technological fields in Electrical Engineering.
